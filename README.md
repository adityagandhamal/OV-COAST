# OC-COAST: Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation [CVPRW 2025]
The official implementation of OV-COAST

Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world mod
els such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization,
 we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV
COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To
 align visual-language features within the framework of opti
mal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a
 cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two dis
tributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization
 strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem
 is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain
 an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is
 used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evalu
ate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark,
 where our approach notably improves the performance of
 the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone,
 achieving superior resultsâ€”surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72%
 and SAN-B by 4.9% mIoU.
